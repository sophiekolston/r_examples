## Introduction
Anthropogenic cimate change is a global issue that has and will continue to cause irreversible damage to a significant proportion of the global population (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021; PÃ¶rtner et al., 2022). We need to monitor how humans are influencing the climate such that we can adjust our behaviour to mitigate the worst effects of a changing climate. Greenhouse gas emissions and indicators of climate are important as they can measure our direct influence on the climate system (Fawzy et al., 2020). In this report I will explore an emissions variable and an indicator variable, showing how open-source tools and data can be used by anyone to make a simple assessment of a changing climate.
 
When looking at the causes of anthropogenic climate change we often look at carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) emissions. It's difficult to measure at the source, but luckily we have long-term time series of CO$_2$ so we can explore the relationship it has on climate conditions. But how do we measure climate conditions? A key player in the climate system is the ocean, which has a huge impact of heat distribution and transmission globally. Heat distribution leads to weather, the extremes of which are a good barometer of climate change. So the temperature of the ocean, particularly the surface which leads to winds and localised weather, can be a good (but not complete!) measure of climate conditions. This measure is called Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and is a common feature of climate models.

I want to look at the relationship between SST and CO$_2$, as well as looking at how these variables vary over space and time. This may give an indication of how anthropogenic climate change correlates to more extreme weather, using CO$_2$ concentration and SST as our representatives.

I will be exploring the following questions:

* How has SST varied over space and time?
* How has CO$_2$ varied over time?
* Do these variables exhibit seasonal variation?
* What is the relationship between CO$_2$ and SST?

I will explore these by manipulating and visualising the data in various formats. I'll start with SST, then move to CO$_2$, then combine the data and explore them together. All of my code will be presented so you can complete, critique, and build upon the analyses yourself!

## Prerequisities
If you have downloaded the markdown file and want to run this yourself, make sure you download the data (placed in a folder named 'data' in the directory of the markdown folder). You will also need to install all of the packages I use (see Setting Up). Note that a couple of the visualisations take a while to render, especially the SST animation which also takes up a ~150mb of storage (although you can delete the frames as soon as you have rendered the video).

## Data
As I mentioned before, we have long-term time series of CO$_2$ data. I will use the Mauna Loa open dataset, which goes back to the mid 1950s and measures CO$_2$ concentration at a station in Hawaii. The data are maintained by the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov/). You can find the dataset at the [Global Monitoring Laboratory of NOAA](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html), which is open and accessible with attribution (Keeling et al., 2001).

Measuring SST is difficult as it requires vessel expeditions. These days you can measure from space with satellites, but these time series only go back to when satellites were first launched in the ~1980s. If we want to go further back we need models. I will be using the 
The Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) model data. ERSST data are derived from a set of marine/ocean observations, then modelled alongside other climate variables. The data are monthly averages, ranging from 1854 to 2020. You can find the dataset on the [NOAA gridded data site](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.v5.html). This dataset is also open and accessible (Huang et al., 2017).

## Setting up
First let's load up all the packages needed for the analyses. I will also set the working directory - if you have downloaded the zip file it should work automatically, setting the working directory to be the location of the folder. 
```{r 0_envsetup}
# load packages to use throughout
library(this.path)  # easy obtaining of source file dir/path
library(ggplot2)  # plotting
library(ncdf4)  # netcdf parsing 
library(raster)  # raster analysis
library(tidyverse)  # data manipulation
library(lubridate)  # date manipulation
library(tmap)  # mapping
library(av)  # video file creation
library(sf)  # spatial feature manipulation
library(scales)  # useful for setting labels/removing sci notation
library(latex2exp)  # latex rendering for equations/labels
library(ggfortify)  # plotting and exploring models
library(plotly)  # interactive plotting

# set working directory to that of this rmd file
#   this is assuming zip file with contents were not modified, such that the /data/ relative path will work
setwd(this.path::here())  

# create directories for plots
#   these will not crash, only warn if the directories already exist, so 
#   no need to check if folders exist already
dir.create('vis_frames/')
dir.create('plots/')
```

## Loading and exploring the datasets individually

### Sea surface temperature
There are a few options to load up NetCDF data, which is what the SST data are saved as. First I will use the ncdf4 library to load it up and look at the metadata. 

```{r 1_loadsstnc}
# load sea surface temperature data with ncdf4 library
sst <- nc_open('data/sst.mnmean.v3.nc')

sst  # print data info
```

We can see a lot of information here! We have 2 variables - time range (time_bnds) and SST. The SST contains latitude (lat) and longitude (lon) and time. Latitude and longitude are our y and x values respectively, so we can make maps. These are recorded at 2$^\circ$ precision. Time is in the unit of days since 01/01/1800... we will probably have to convert this. Other than that we have lots of other information about the data under global attributes. 

Next I will load up the data as a stack of spatial rasters so we can map everything.

```{r 2_loadsstrast}
# load sst data as raster stack
sst_rast <- stack('data/sst.mnmean.v3.nc')

sst_rast  # print data info
```

We can see the raster stack has the same amount of layers as the size of time (1994), indicating that there is a raster for each point of time data. The names confirm this, with each layer having a date as the name (it looks like the raster library has parsed the date into a format we can read easily, so the conversion will be straightforward). The coordinate reference system is [WGS84](https://www.linz.govt.nz/guidance/geodetic-system/coordinate-systems-used-new-zealand/geodetic-datums/world-geodetic-system-1984-wgs84), which you can guess from the range of coordinate values when we first opened the data.

First let's take a look at the underlying geometry to see how the raster is laid out.

```{r 3_visrastgeom}
# convert raster stack to points
#   each point is an xy - a cell of the raster, along with the associated data 
#   that we found with the previous nc open (time, sst)
sst_df <- data.frame(rasterToPoints(sst_rast))

# plot geometry
sst_geom <- sst_df %>% select(c(x, y))  # extract geometry from df
# convert to simple feature. use WGS84 (epsg:4326) as that was the CRS listed in the raster stack
sst_geom_sf <- st_as_sf(sst_geom, coords=c('x', 'y'), crs=4326)

# note here that I am not going to save plots as variables except where necessary
#   this code already saves a fair bit in memory so I want to reduce this where I
#   can. the plots will show in markdown, and if you want to save them as image
#   files you can modify the code

# make map of raster stack geometry
tm_shape(sst_geom_sf) +
  tm_dots(size=0.001, col='red', title='Data point') +  # point data
  # set title, size, position. make north arrow and scale appear outside of the map
  tm_layout(main.title='SST data points',
            main.title.size=1,
            main.title.position='center',
            frame=FALSE,
            attr.outside=TRUE) +
  tm_scale_bar(position=c('left', 'top'), breaks=c(0, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000)) +  # add scale bar at set breaks (km)
  tm_compass(size=1, position=c('right', 'top')) +  # add north arrow
  tm_grid() +  # add x/y reference grid
  tm_xlab('Longitude') +  # set x label  (longitude)
  tm_ylab('Latitude') +  # set y label (latitude)
  tm_add_legend(type='symbol', label='Data point', col='red') +  # add legend
  tm_legend(position=c(0.6, -0.3))   # change legend position
```

Looks like the raster is a grid with no values on land - makes sense as the data are ocean-based. What about the underlying raster values?

I am going to convert the data into long format and add some more information that will be helpful when picking out trends, like climate zone (eg. antarctic, tropical, etc.).

```{r 4_sstdata}
# create long version of SST data
#   this will have rows for each x, y, date and variable
#   I will also classify the climate zone of each point based on lat/lon
sst_df_long <- sst_df %>%
  # move SST to long, retain x and y, name by date
  pivot_longer(cols=-c('x', 'y'), names_to='date', values_to='sst') %>%  
  # format dates. We will use different dates for plotting throughout
  #   I am using lubridate to change date formats, get month and year etc.
  mutate(date_day=as_date(date, format='X%Y.%m.%d'), date_month=format(date_day, '%Y-%m')) %>%
  mutate(year=year(date_day), month=month(date_day), 
         # define hemispheres
         # assumption: that values of exactly 0 deg lat are in southern hemisphere
         #    and values of exactly 180 deg lon are eastern hempishere
         lat_hem=case_when(y > 0 ~ 'northern', y <= 0 ~ 'southern'),
         lon_hem=case_when(x < 180 ~ 'western', x >= 180 ~ 'eastern'),
         # define tropical/subtropical climates
         zone=case_when((y > 23 & y <= 66) ~ 'northern temperate zone',
                        (y > 66) ~ 'arctic',
                        (y <= 23 & y >= -23) ~ 'tropical',
                        (y < -23 & y >= -66) ~ 'southern temperate zone',
                        (y < -66) ~ 'antarctic')) %>%
  select(-date)  # remove original date

head(sst_df_long)  # print the start of the long data to show structure

range(sst_df_long$date_day)  # print date range

# plot distribution of values
ggplot(sst_df_long, aes(x=sst)) +  # dist of sst
  geom_histogram() +  # histogram plot
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  # set labels
  labs(x='SST (\u00B0C)', y='Count of data points', title='Distribution of all SST values') +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_comma()) +  # format number to have commas, not sci notation
  scale_x_continuous() +  # set x axis to continuous
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre plot title 
```

The distribution is heavily skewed towards the lower and higher ends. The data ranges from the start of 1854 to the start of 2020. Now let's try and visualise SST using the raster stack. We know the rasters are stacked by time, so I will take a couple of rasters based on this attribute to map SST at 2 time periods

```{r 5_sstmaps}
# I have defined these breaks after looking at the distribution of values
#   these should present the data well
sst_val_brks <- c(-5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35)

# function for producing sst maps
#   I will do this a lot so making a function to not repeat code
#   will not parameterize things like textNA, data title because the function
#   is designed for a single data source that I know
get_sst_map <- function(data, title, palette='-Spectral', style='cont',  # set default parameters
                        palette_mid=15, 
                        scale_breaks=c(0, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000),
                        colourblind=FALSE) {
  
  # use colour-blind (deuterantopia, protanopia, tritanonia) friendly palette
  #   if the user inputs it. this is extremely important when mapping with a
  #   high range colour scheme. this could just be done with the palette parameter,
  #   but I think its nice to not make a colourblind person have to go through
  #   colour palettes themselves
  if (colourblind) {
    palette <- 'BrBG'
  }
  
  # create map
  map <- tm_shape(data) +  # shape around input data
    # we know the input will be of raster type, so plot with raster
    #   use parameter values where it might change
    tm_raster(palette=palette, midpoint=palette_mid, colorNA='gray', textNA='Land',
              breaks=sst_val_brks, title='SST (\u00B0C)', style=style) +
    # adjust map. set legend position, title and sizing
    tm_layout(legend.outside.position=c('right'),
                legend.outside.size=0.2,
                legend.outside=TRUE,
                legend.title.size=1,
                main.title=title,
                main.title.size=1,
                panel.label.size=0.05,
                legend.width=1) +
    tm_scale_bar(position=c(0.01, 0), breaks=scale_breaks) +
    tm_compass(size=0.8, text.size=0.8, position=c(0.93, 0.03)) # add scale bar 
  
  return(map)  # return map object
}

# save map at 01/01/1854
sst_185401 <- get_sst_map(sst_rast$X1854.01.01, 'SST at 01/01/1854',
                          style='pretty')  # use pretty (classified) style

# save map at 01/01/2019
sst_201901 <- get_sst_map(sst_rast$X2019.01.01, 'SST at 01/01/2019',
                          style='pretty')  # use pretty (classified) style

# plot both maps side-by-side
tmap_arrange(sst_185401, sst_201901, ncol=1, asp=2)
```

The temperature looks to be increasing, but that is only 2 time points out of a total of 1994. I thought I would visualise all data by creating an animation of SST over time, with each frame in the animation being a plot at a given time point.

```{r 6_sstanimation}
# I found that the animation functions (eg. gganimate) could not really handle
#   1994 unique visualisations. So I output each plot as a frame that I then
#   convert to a video. This requires storage of the rendered frames (images)
#   of around 250mb, but does mean that all the processing can happen in 
#   advance and so the visualisation itself is very smooth. The images take 
#   about 5 minutes to save and the video processing takes about 30 seconds.
#   I have included the code to create the visualisation here, as well as the
#   output in the folder in case you want to save time.

# If you want to stitch the images manually in ffmpeg, you can use: 
#   'cat $(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.jpeg" | sort -V) | ffmpeg 
#     -framerate 15 -i - sst_vis.mp4'

sst_vis_fname <- 'plots/sst_animation.mp4'  # set output file name

# check if the output file exists. if it does exist, begin processing
if (!file.exists(sst_vis_fname)) {
  
  # for each raster in the raster stack
  for (x in 1:dim(sst_rast)[3]) {
    # create a frame identifier, in this case the order the raster is in the 
    #   stack (which is sorted by date). add leading zeros for file sorting
    frame_id <- str_pad(x, 4, pad = '0') 
    fname <- paste('vis_frames/', frame_id, '.jpeg', sep='')  # create filename for frame
  
    # parse the date of the current frame to use as plot title 
    #   have to account for the leading 'X' in the raster name
    map_date <- as_date(names(sst_rast[[x]])[[1]], format='X%Y.%m.%d')
  
    # get map using function
    #   use continuous style to have a smoother representation of the data
    #   this is important when scrolling through frames in a video
    cur_map <- get_sst_map(sst_rast[[x]], title=paste(map_date), style='cont')
  
    # save map as file, with set size that works for aspect ratio of data
    tmap_save(cur_map, fname, width=1500, height=800, dpi=200)

  }
  
  # obtain list of all frames (all jpeg files in output folder)
  list_of_frames <- list.files('vis_frames', pattern='*.jpeg', full.names=T)
  
  # encode video - stitch all frames together at a frame rate of 20 frames per second
  av_encode_video(list_of_frames, framerate=20, output=sst_vis_fname)
  }
```

![](plots/sst_animation.mp4){width="100%"}

This animation shows us some of the spatial and temporal patterns in the data. We can see strong seasonal variation with temperature oscillating between North and South. If you focus on South America you can even see the reduction in temperature extending West due to El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation. I think I can see bands of higher temperature extending beyond the tropics as time increases, but I am not certain. We can test for this!

First I will get a global average of temperature and see how this changes over time. Since we only have 2 months of data in 2020, I am going to exclude data from this year from here on. The lower data points for this year will skew any averages, so for simplicity I will just remove them.

```{r 7_sstglobalaverages}
# get all data before 2020 
sst_df_long <- sst_df_long %>% filter(year < 2020)

# create global average of data, aggregating each month
sst_globalavg_mth <- sst_df_long %>% 
  group_by(date_day) %>%  # group by date (date each month)
  summarise(mean_sst=mean(sst)) %>%  # calculate mean
  ungroup() %>%  # ungroup
  mutate(month=month(date_day, label=TRUE))  # get month name for facets

# create global average of data, aggregating each year
sst_globalavg_yr <- sst_df_long %>%
  group_by(year) %>%  # group by year
  summarise(mean_sst=mean(sst)) %>%  # calculate mean
  ungroup() %>%  # ungroup
  mutate(year_date=ymd(year, truncated=2L))  # convert date to year as date (first of first month, for plotting)

# plot global averages of sst
ggplot() +
  # line for monthly average (x of date, y of sst, save to Month colour group)
  geom_line(data=sst_globalavg_mth, aes(x=date_day, y=mean_sst, col='Month'))  +
  # line for yearly average (x of date, y of sst, save to Annual colour group)
  geom_line(data=sst_globalavg_yr, aes(x=year_date, y=mean_sst, col='Annual')) +
  # add manual scale colour, setting title to period and colours according to group
  scale_colour_manual(name='Period', values=c('Annual'='red', 'Month'='black')) +
  labs(x='Date', y='Mean SST (\u00B0C)', title='Global SST over time') +  # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text

# interactive plot with date slider (monthly average sst over time)
plot_ly(sst_globalavg_mth, x=~date_day) %>%   # get only average vals
  add_lines(y=~mean_sst, line=list(color='black')) %>%  # add line plot, y of sst
  # set layout. change axis labels, title, add date range slider
  layout(xaxis=list(title='Date', rangeslider=list(type='date')), 
         yaxis=list(title='Mean SST (\u00B0C)'),
         title='Global SST over time (monthly)')
```

Looks like there is a significant increase over time, but with lots of seasonal variation. Let's explore that splitting the data by month.

```{r 8_sstglobalaveragesmonthly}
# plot global averages of sst, split by month 
ggplot() +
  # line for monthly average, (x of date, y of sst)
  geom_line(data=sst_globalavg_mth, aes(x=date_day, y=mean_sst))  +
  facet_wrap(~month) +  # split plot by month
  labs(x='Date', y='Mean SST (\u00B0C)', title='Global SST over time by month') + # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text
```

All months appear to show an increase in mean SST over time, with a dip in the early 1900s. In the animation it looked like SST varied a lot spatially. So let's plot by the climate zones that we defined earlier (eg. tropical, arctic etc.).

```{r 9_sstzoneaverages}
# group by climate zones
sst_yr_zones <- sst_df_long %>% 
  group_by(zone, year) %>%  # group by climate zone and year 
  summarise(mean_sst=mean(sst)) %>%   # calculate mean sst
  ungroup() %>%  # ungroup
  mutate(year_date=ymd(year, truncated=2L))  # convert date to year as date (first of first month, for plotting)

# plot sst by year, grouped by climate zone
ggplot(sst_yr_zones, aes(x=year_date, y=mean_sst)) +
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  facet_wrap(~zone, scale='free') +  # group by climate zone, scale freely for appropriate y limits
  scale_x_date() +  # use date scale for x axis
  labs(y='Mean SST (\u00B0C)', x='Date', title='SST by climate zone') +  # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text
```

All climate zones appear to be increase in temperature except for Antarctic, although the small range of this data implies the increase may be insignificant. Let's hone in on this spatial variation by exploring the relationship between latitude/longitude and average SST.

```{r 10_sstbylatlon}
# calculate sst by x and y coordinates
sst_by_xy <- sst_df_long %>% 
  # use only set years to reduce size of data/increase plot legibility
  filter(year %in% c(1875, 1900, 1925, 1950, 1975, 2000)) %>% 
  mutate(Latitude=y, Longitude=x) %>%  # convert labels for plotting
  group_by(Longitude, Latitude, year) %>%  # group by lat, lon and year
  # convert to long format with lat and lon, so can facet by axis
  pivot_longer(c(Longitude, Latitude), names_to='axis', values_to='coordinate') %>%
  ungroup() %>%  # ungroup
  # group by axis and coordinate
  #   have to group by twice as it needs to be pivoted before grouping again
  group_by(axis, coordinate, year) %>%  
  summarise(sst=mean(sst)) %>%  # calculate mean sst
  ungroup() %>%  # ungroup
  mutate(year=as.factor(year))  # convert to factor for categorical plotting

# plot sst over set times, facet by xy axis
ggplot(sst_by_xy, aes(x=coordinate, y=sst, col=year)) +
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  facet_wrap(~axis, scale='free') +  # group by axis, free scale for appropriate y limits
  labs(x='Coordinate (degrees)', y='Mean SST (\u00B0C)', 
       title='SST by latitude/longitude and year') +  # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text
```

The above plot shows a strong relationship between latitude and SST, matching the previous maps which show the tropics have higher temperatures. Longitude has a weaker relationship, with a dip around 25$^\circ$ and another around 300$^\circ$. Both show that the relationship between latitude/longitude does not appear to change over time, except for slight increases in magnitude overall as time goes on.

Finally, let's look at a specific region before taking a look at the CO$_2$ data. I can crop the raster with a bounding box, save it as a stack then manipulate it in the same way as the entire dataset.

```{r 11_sstoceania}
# set bounding box coordinates
# converts to df, then polygon. I have used the original vector then converted 
#   to df so I can use http://bboxfinder.com and simply copy and paste the 
#   values into that variable
bbox <- c(90.351563,-54.367759,190.898438,9.795678)  # vector of coords from http://bboxfinder.com
bbox_df <- data.frame(x=c(bbox[1], bbox[3]), y=c(bbox[2], bbox[4]))  # extract coords to df
# convert df to simple feature, then get bounding box of that sf, then convert that to sf
bbox_poly <- st_as_sfc(st_bbox(st_as_sf(bbox_df, coords=c('x', 'y'), crs=4326)))

sst_rast_oc <- stack(crop(sst_rast, st_as_sf(bbox_poly)))  # crop raster to bbox

# get map of cropped stack in 1854
# note the changed input parameters to represent the different values of this small extent
sst_map_oc_1854 <- get_sst_map(sst_rast_oc$X1854.01.01, 'SST in Oceania at 01/01/1854', 
                          palette_mid=20, scale_breaks=c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000),
                          style='pretty')

# get map of cropped stack in 2019
# note the changed input parameters to represent the different values of this small extent
sst_map_oc_2019 <- get_sst_map(sst_rast_oc$X2019.01.01, 'SST in Oceania at 01/01/2019', 
                          palette_mid=20, scale_breaks=c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000),

The coarse resolution of the data is more apparent in this zoomed-in map of Oceania. That being said, SST still shows notable variation so I can be reasonably confident that global averages will account for local variation to some extent.

Overall I can conclude that SST has increased since 1854, based on this modelled data. This includes when accounting for seasonal variation through averaging. SST varies spatially, with high temperatures around the tropics and low temperatures near the poles. All climate zones have increased in SST except for the Antarctic, which has decreased slightly. Latitude has a far stronger relationship with temperature than longitude. Despite the coarse resolution, SST clearly varies spatially so we can be confident that the global averages account for spatial variation.

### Carbon Dioxide
Next we will load up the CO$_2$ dataset. This dataset is not spatial, so the manipulation process is a bit more straightforward.

```{r 12_loadco2}
# load co2 data. skip header (first 56 rows)
co2 <- read.csv('data/co2_mm_mlo.csv', skip=56)

head(co2)  # print first few rows of data
```

The variables I am interested in are CO$_2$ concentration (average), deaseasonalized CO$_2$ concentration (deaseasonalized), and time (decimal.date). We will have to do something with that date to match it up with the SST.

```{r 13_cleanandvisco2}
# parse dates, convert to long format, drop unused columns
co2_df <- co2 %>% 
  mutate(date_day=as_date(date_decimal(co2$decimal.date)),
         date_month=format(date_day, '%Y-%m')) %>%  # parse dates
  mutate(avg_co2=average, deseas_avg_co2=deseasonalized) %>%  # rename cols
  select(year, month, date_day, date_month, avg_co2, deseas_avg_co2) %>%  # select cols I want
  # pivot by co2 conc measurement type (desasonalized or normal)
  pivot_longer(cols=c(avg_co2, deseas_avg_co2), names_to='type', values_to='co2_conc') %>%
  mutate(month_label=month(month, label=TRUE))  # get month name

head(co2_df)  # print first few rows of data

# I chose to use TeX instead of markdown themes for subscript because
#   markdown themes offer less plot customization, particularly centreing 
#   plot titles which I really like doing. I have to manually reference it
#   with latex2exp:: beacuse there is a conflicting function with plotly

# plot co2 over time
ggplot(co2_df, aes(x=date_day, y=co2_conc, colour=type)) +  # colour by pivoted type
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  scale_x_date(date_labels='%Y', date_breaks='5 years') +  # format x axis to have labels every 5 years
  labs(x='Date', y=latex2exp::TeX('Average CO$_2$ concentration (ppm)'), colour='Data type', 
       title=latex2exp::TeX('CO$_2$ concentration over time')) +  # set labels
  # set colour scale according to type
  scale_colour_manual(values=c('red', 'black'), labels=c('Average', 'Deaseasonalized average')) +
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  # centre title text, move legend to bottom of plot
  theme(legend.position='bottom', plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

# interactive plot with date slider (average co2 over time)
plot_ly(co2_df %>% filter(type == 'avg_co2'), x=~date_day) %>%   # get only average vals
  add_lines(y=~co2_conc, line=list(color='black')) %>%  # add line plot, y of co2
  # set layout. change axis labels, title, add date range slider
  layout(xaxis=list(title='Date', rangeslider=list(type='date')), 
         yaxis=list(title='Average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (ppm)'),
         title='CO<sub>2</sub> concentration over time')
```

That's a pretty clear trend! Even with seasonal variation, CO$_2$ concentration certainly increases over time. But let's confirm about the seasonal variation to validate their deasonalized trend. 

```{r 14_co2bymonth}
# plot co2 over time grouped by month
ggplot(co2_df, aes(x=date_day, y=co2_conc)) +
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  facet_wrap(~month_label) +  # group by month
  labs(x='Date', y=latex2exp::TeX('Average CO$_2$ concentration (ppm)'),
       title=latex2exp::TeX('CO$_2$ concentration over time by month')) +  # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text
```

Looks like the increase is linear across the seasons/months. Let's compare the overall trend to a linear trend.

```{r 15_co2linear}
# plot co2 with linear trend line
ggplot(co2_df %>% filter(type == 'avg_co2'), aes(x=date_day, y=co2_conc)) +  # plot average only
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  geom_smooth(type=lm, col='blue') +  # add linear smoother/trend line
  scale_x_date(date_labels='%Y', date_breaks='5 years') +  # format x axis to have labels every 5 years
  labs(x='Date', y=latex2exp::TeX('Average CO$_2$ concentration (ppm)'), colour='Data type', 
       title=latex2exp::TeX('CO$_2$ concentration over time with linear trend (blue)')) +  # set labels
  # set colour scale according to type (only 1 type here)
  scale_colour_manual(values=c('black'), labels=c('Average')) +
  theme_bw() +  # set theme 
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text

```

I can conclude that averaged CO$_2$ concentration, as measured (and modelled where necessary) by this dataset, has increased since 1958. This increase follows a linear trend, and has occured in every season.

## Merging data
Now I will combine the SST and CO$_2$ data so I can explore their relationship. I will remove the spatial component of the SST data as the CO$_2$ data are non-spatial, creating a global average of SST before joining. I could go the other way around - extrapolating the CO$_2$ data to the SST spatial points, but since we only have one spatial location (Hawaii, where the CO$_2$ data were recorded) this would not be very effective.

```{r 16_dateranges}
range(co2_df$date_month)  # get range of dates in co2 data
range(sst_df_long$date_month)  # get range of dates in sst data
```

I will join by date, resulting in a dataset that has CO$_2$ and SST data at each month. The SST data are modelled for the first of each month, while the CO$_2$ data are collected around the middle of each month. For the purposes of this report, I will be using only monthly aggregations, and will essentially ignore day. In the case of the CO$_2$ data are averaged monthly so the day is less important, so I believe removing day from the analyses is an acceptable assumption. Above we can see that SST data range from 01/1854 to 12/2019 (remember I filtered the latter value to max at 2019) while the CO$_2$ data range from 03/1958 to 02/2023. I will take the most data that fit between both ranges, provided each year has a full 12 months of data. We saw with the SST data that we need a full year to get a good average/representation. So my final range will be 01/1959 to 12/2019.

```{r 17_joindata}
daterange <- interval(ymd('1959-01-01'), ymd('2019-12-31'))  # set date range/interval

# filter co2 by date range
co2_df_datefilter <- co2_df %>%
  filter(date_day %within% daterange) %>%
   # pivot wider so I can pivot longer when data are merged (don't need deaseasonalized anymore)
  pivot_wider(names_from=type, values_from=co2_conc) 

# filter sst data by date range
sst_df_datefilter <- sst_globalavg_mth %>%
  filter(date_day %within% daterange) %>%
  mutate(date_month=format(date_day, '%Y-%m'), avg_sst=mean_sst)  # consistent names (mean=avg)

# we want wide and long formats because we are going to plot the relationship 
#   between variables that would not be easy in long format

# create wide format
#   we want wide format here because we are going to plot the relationship 
#   between variables that would not be easy in long format
co2_sst <- co2_df_datefilter %>% 
  # remove suffix for y data - we are keeping this as the main date as explained above
  left_join(sst_df_datefilter, by='date_month', suffix=c('.x', '')) %>%  
  select(year, date_month, month_label, date_day, avg_co2, avg_sst)  # select vars of interest

head(co2_sst)  # display first few rows of wide data

# create long format
co2_sst_long <- co2_sst %>%
  # pivot by data type (co2/sst)
  pivot_longer(cols=c(avg_co2, avg_sst), names_to='data_type', values_to='value')
  
head(co2_sst_long)  # display first few rows of long data

```

## Exploring CO$_2$ and SST
Now we have a merged, cleaned dataset for SST and CO$_2$. Let's explore it!

```{r 18_plotboth}
# set labels. can't use tex here so used unicode for subscript 2
co2_sst_labels <- as_labeller(c('avg_co2'='Average CO\u2082 (ppm)', 
                                'avg_sst'='Average SST (\u00B0C)'))
# plot co2 and sst over time next to each other
ggplot(co2_sst_long, aes(x=year, y=value)) +
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  # wrap by data type (co2/sst), scale freely, apply labels
  facet_wrap(~data_type, scale='free', labeller=co2_sst_labels) + 
  labs(x='Date', y='Value', title=latex2exp::TeX('Average CO$_2$ and SST over time (annually)')) +  # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text

# plot co2 against sst
ggplot(co2_sst, aes(x=avg_co2, y=avg_sst)) +
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  geom_smooth(type='lm') +  # add linear trend/smoother
  labs(x=latex2exp::TeX('Average CO$_2$ (ppm)'), y='Average SST (\u00B0C)',
       title=latex2exp::TeX('Relationship between monthly CO$_2$ and SST')) +  # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme 
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text
```

Plotting the two variables together confirms that as CO$_2$ and SST increase over time. When we plot them against one another, removing the time component, we can see that as CO$_2$ increases, so does SST. There is quite a lot of variation between the linear trend, so let's check how this varies by month.

```{r 19_bothbymonth}
# plot co2 against sst by month
ggplot(co2_sst, aes(x=avg_co2, y=avg_sst)) +
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  facet_wrap(~month_label) +  # group by month
  labs(x=latex2exp::TeX('Average CO$_2$ (ppm)'), y='Average SST (\u00B0C)',
       title=latex2exp::TeX('Relationship between monthly CO$_2$ and SST by month')) +  # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre title text
```

Seems to be a pretty consistent upwards trend between the two variables regardless of the month, varying a bit by magnitude of increase. Since we have a linear relationship, we can build a linear model.

```{r 20_monthlymodel}
 # create linear model of sst and co2 by month
co2_sst.mod <- lm(avg_sst ~ avg_co2, data=co2_sst) 

summary(co2_sst.mod)  # print model information

autoplot(co2_sst.mod)  # plot model information (residuals)
```

I am not too confident with this model. While the variables do seem to increase together, I don't think I can claim that one has a strong correlation with the other given the low r$^2$ and high variation in residuals. This may be due to the high seasonal variation in magnitude of values, which we can test for by taking yearly averages instead of monthly.

```{r 21_yearlymodel}
# create yearly aggregation of sst and co2
co2_sst_yearly <- co2_sst %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%  # group by year
  summarise(avg_sst=mean(avg_sst), avg_co2=mean(avg_co2)) %>%   # get means of sst and co2
  ungroup()  # ungroup

# plot co2 against sst by year
ggplot(co2_sst_yearly, aes(x=avg_co2, y=avg_sst)) +
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  geom_smooth(type='lm') +  # add linear smoother/trend
  labs(x=latex2exp::TeX('Average CO$_2$ (ppm)'), y='Average SST (\u00B0C)',
       title=latex2exp::TeX('Relationship between yearly CO$_2$ and SST')) +  # set labels
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  # centre plot text

 # create linear model of sst and co2, this time by year
co2_sst_yearly.mod <- lm(avg_sst ~ avg_co2, data=co2_sst_yearly) 

summary(co2_sst_yearly.mod)  # print model information

autoplot(co2_sst_yearly.mod)  # plot model information (residuals)
```

That looks a bit better. The r$^2$ is high and the residuals have a non-static trend. There is still significant variation away from the linear trend line as the underlying averages change between years in non-linear ways. I think there is a need for a more complex model that can account for seasonal and sub-seasonal variation. Regardless, we might as well try and predict some values.

```{r 22_comparemodels}
# create x (co2) values to predict y (sst) values at
co2_to_predict <- seq(300, 500, by=1)  # 300 to 500 every 1

# create dataframe with x values to then join predicted y values to (yearly)
co2_sst_yearly.preds <- data.frame(avg_co2=co2_to_predict)  
# create predictions based on yearly model
co2_sst_yearly.preds$avg_sst <- predict(object=co2_sst_yearly.mod, newdata=co2_sst_yearly.preds)

# create dataframe with x values to then join predicted y values to (monthly)
co2_sst.preds <- data.frame(avg_co2=co2_to_predict)
# create predictions based on monthly model
co2_sst.preds$avg_sst <- predict(object=co2_sst.mod, newdata=co2_sst.preds)

# plot both model predictions with background yearly data
#   (choosing yearly as background because it is easier to plot)
ggplot(co2_sst_yearly, aes(x=avg_co2, y=avg_sst, col='data')) +
  geom_line() +  # line geometry
  # plot yearly predictions as line, save in its own group
  geom_line(data=co2_sst_yearly.preds, aes(x=avg_co2, y=avg_sst, col='pred_yr')) +
  # plot monthly predictions as line, save in its own group
  geom_line(data=co2_sst.preds, aes(x=avg_co2, y=avg_sst, col='pred_mt')) +
  # set labels
  labs(x=latex2exp::TeX('Average CO$_2$ (ppm)'), y='Average SST (\u00B0C)',
       title=latex2exp::TeX('Relationship between yearly CO$_2$ and SST with predictions')) +
  theme_bw() +  # set theme
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))  +  # centre title text
  # set colours manually based on group
  scale_colour_manual(name='Trend', 
                      values=c('pred_yr'='red', 'data'='black', 'pred_mt'='blue'), 
                      labels=c('pred_yr'='Predictions (yearly model)', 'data'='Data', 
                               'pred_mt'='Predictions (monthly model)'))
```

The plot above shows that the monthly and yearly models did not have much of a trend change. The r$^2$ was higher because less seasonal variation (and less data in general) was behind the model, so while the trend was the same the calculated relationship was stronger to the source data - I do not think this is a much better model as a result. Overall, the linear model does show the overall trend of increase, but monthly and yearly fluctuations in the relationship between CO$_2$ and SST are not accounted for. As such, I would use the model for rough estimations of SST based on CO$_2$ values, but would consider a large margin of error.

## Conclusion
Overall I think there is a correlation between CO$_2$ and SST, showing that as carbon dioxide increases so will sea surface temperature. This is a problem as carbon emissions are slowing but not stopping, and I am sure we are yet to see the latent effect of CO$_2$ rise on SST. I have shown how an emissions and climate indicator can be explored independently and together pretty easily. Global climate models are complicated and not very accessible as a result. But their data, such as the SST used in this model, can be loaded up with a few lines of code which is important to build on our understanding of the climate system and our trust of these models. Measured emissions data is more straightforward, but it can still be very important to look at raw data yourself to validate the headlines you see in the news! This code is an example of how you can that.

That being said, my analysis has some flaws. Comparing a spatial dataset to a non-spatial dataset can be problematic, and I think we need a spatial distribution of CO$_2$ in order to confirm the trend seen in this data. I found that applying a simple linear model seasonal data was not very effective, although it does give a baseline with which we can make some conclusions, albiet with a high margin of error in the exact value.

R was a super effective tool at manipulating and visualising these datasets. I would like to see a few more simple options for reprojecting and visualising rasters with webmaps as this was tricky in practice. Despite that, I was able to show how SST varied spatially and seasonally, and how CO$_2$ varied spatially. I then merged them both to see how they correlated. 

In theory much of this code could be repurposed to look at any netcdf climate file as they often have 2$^\circ$ regular grids. Have a go yourself!
